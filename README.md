## Coursera Regression Project

## Description

This project is for the course "Linear Regression and Modeling", the third in the five course sequence of courses for the Coursera Specialization "Statistics with R" produced by Duke University.

A movies data set was provided by the course for the project.  The aim of the project is to come up with a research question, to perform an exploratory data analysis, to create a model, to make predictions using the model, and then to answer the initial research question.

The data set is comprised of 651 randomly sampled movies, described by 32 variables.  The sources for the data set are the Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB APIs; URLs to both websites are provided for each movie in the data set.
