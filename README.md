## Multiple Linear Regression Modeling and Movie Prediction using Data from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB

### Project Description

This project was produced in 2019 for the course **"Linear Regression and Modeling"**, the third in the five course sequence for the Coursera Specialization **Statistics with R** produced by Duke University.

Given a data set of movies released between the years 1970 to 2014, the aims of the project were to:

- develop a research question to answer using regression modeling in `R`
- perform and document an exploratory data analysis (EDA) in an `R` Markdown file supported by numerical summaries and visualizations
- develop a multiple linear regression model
- pick a new movie not in the sample and use the model to make a prediction

The data set (`movies.Rdata`) is comprised of 651 randomly sampled movies, described by 32 variables.  The sources for the data set are the Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB APIs; URLs to both websites are provided for each movie in the data set.

Coding and documentation were done using `R` and an `R` Markdown file to produce the [project report](https://brianallan.github.io/Regression-Modeling-and-Movie-Prediction/).



### Files Used 

reg_model_project.Rmd  
movies.Rdata   

### Tools Used

`R` with `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `statsr` libraries in RStudio.
